			   "description": "The search query's keywords (and optional field filters). The search is not case-sensitive: 'roadhouse' will match 'Roadhouse', 'roadHouse', etc. Keywords will be matched in any order unless surrounded by quotes, thus q=roadhouse&20blues will match both 'Blues Roadhouse' and 'Roadhouse of the Blues'. Quotation marks can be used to limit the match to a phrase: q=roadhouse&20blues will match 'My Roadhouse Blues' but not 'Roadhouse of the Blues'. By default, results are returned when a match is found in any field of the target object type. Searches can be made more specific by specifying an album, artist or track field filter. For example q=album:gold%20artist:abba&type=album will search for albums with the text 'gold' in the album name and the text 'abba' in an artist name. Other possible field filters, depending on object types being searched, include year, genre, upc, and isrc. For example, q=damian%20genre:reggae-pop&type=artist. The asterisk (*) character can, with some limitations, be used as a wildcard (maximum: 2 per query). It will match a variable number of non-white-space characters. It cannot be used in a quoted phrase, in a field filter, or as the first character of the keyword string. Searching for playlists will return results matching the playlist's name and/or description.",
